# pyahp
Tool to perform Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) exercises in Python

## Repository Notes
This tool is not even *remotely* ready for usage. It's primarily a place for me to play around in Python for the time being. If you somehow come across this repository (hi!) and are so inclined, feel free to raise any issues or submit pull requests. I'm just getting my feet wet in actually contributing to the FOSS world, so apologies for any missteps or delays. This repository is here because I'm moving between several computers and this is the easiest way I've found to 1) begin to get an understanding git/github and how various processes work and 2) ensure I'm working from the same codebase across computers.
